# STATE

## Decisions

### AD-001
- **Decision**: marmiflix runs on Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) on Vercel, with a single Upstash Redis key (via the Vercel Marketplace integration) as the queue's data store, atomicity via a version-field compare-and-swap (tiny generic Lua script) rather than a full Lua state machine, and realtime sync via client polling (~2s, visibility-paused, exponential backoff) rather than websockets/push.
- **Reason**: Simplest stack that meets the spec's 3s realtime bound and handles serverless-safe deadline timeouts (lazy reap-on-read) without needing a persistent process or a cron job; keeps all business logic in unit-testable TypeScript instead of Lua.
- **Trade-off**: Not true push-based realtime (small polling delay, more request volume than websockets); single Redis key is a write-contention point under heavy concurrent load. Both are explicitly named as the first things to revisit (e.g. swap to Supabase Realtime) if usage ever outgrows this.
- **Scope**: Whole app (only feature so far: lunchbox-queue) - any future feature touching queue state or realtime sync must conform or explicitly supersede this.
- **Date**: 2026-08-18
- **Status**: active
